Did you improve on the design? Did you do something new?
Well you're name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You, the more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, you come too
And then it hit me standing outside of Heaven waitin' for God to come and get me
I'm too uncouth, unschool'd to the rules and too gum shoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool

And out through China nearly misses air liners

Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze

We want it to braid meaning we want it to grow meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called and he told him to wait
Un-strap him from the chair and put him back in his cage

So just take me home where the mood is mellow

Now you gushin', ambulance rushin'
You to the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you're hit 4 times, bullet hit your spine
Paralyzed waist down, now ya wheelchair bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think it all started you fussin' with three guys

All over bullshit dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit

Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?

I won that fight, I lost that war

Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

When the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold
And the music is always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of dat pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today
'Cause there is no tomorrow
Just some picture perfect day
To last a whole lifetime
And it never ends
'Cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So lets just stay in the moment, smoke some weed
Drink some wine
Reminisce talk some shit forever young is in your mind

Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye
So not for legends, I'm forever young
My name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves
Over Pyrex pots, my name shall be passed down to generations while debating up in barber shops
Young slung, hung here
Shorty, the nigga from here
With a little ambition just what we can become here
And as the father passed his story down to his sons ears
Younger kid, younger every year, yeah

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper, before I lay 'em

From Infinite down to the last Relapse album, he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him

I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm, for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth, for that
Fuck your feelin's, instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped

And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground

Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-bloww
'Cause I ain't playin' around, there's a game called circle
And I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down

But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around, but it's time to exorcise these demons

I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground

No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father

You couldn't lift a single shingle on it

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight

High off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fucking hates me and I love it, wait

Where you going, I'm leaving you, no you ain't
Come back, we're running right back here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane

But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped ""who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Eminem:
You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em

You'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em
Throw 'em down pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em

It's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over

But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
But when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please

Come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though

Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall

Next time, there will be no next time, I apologize
Even though I know it's lies, I'm tired of the games
I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

Eminem:
I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubt's startin' to creep in, every day is just so gray and black

Hope, I just need a ray of that
'Cause no one see's my vision when I play it for 'em, they just say it's whack
But they don't know what dope is, and I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest

You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin' you
It's dark, let me turn on the lights and brighten it and enlighten you

I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick you
Gon' either wanna fight, when I get off this fuckin' mic or you
Gon' hug me, but I'm out of options, there's nothin' else I can do, 'cause

Eminem:
It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces so I'm puzzled, 'cause the shit I hear is
Crazy, but you're either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form

Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin', and it's almost like your beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure, no more I demand you remember who you are

It was you, who believed in me, when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre I'm cryin' in this booth

You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I could never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up Dre, I'm dyin' I need you, come back for fuck's sake, 'cause

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoked

Went through friends, some of 'em I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death, but where the fuck are they now
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him

Fuckin' backstabbers, when the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets, and ask where the fuck we been
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots

And the crackers' ass, little Cracker Jack beat makin'
Whack, ass-backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags, and as I'm leavin'
I'll guarantee they'll scream ""Dre don't leave us like that man,"" 'cause

Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fucking illest in this music

Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
The only thing I ever gave up's using, no more excuses

Little hussy ass, 'cause fuck, guess it doesn't matter now, does it

What difference it make, what's it take, to get it through your thick skulls

From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switch blade to a hater's rib cage

Told me ""Baby it's real.""

Baby you know the deal

'Cause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will

And I tell her ""Go on! Pop that pussy for me.""
Haters can't see me but bitches still looking for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about ""I"" give the rest of the vowels back

I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her till she cry, call that ""wine and dine""
Try to check me and imma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say ""Choose wisely,"" that's why I was chosen

Rocking like the asphalt, it's the cash's fault
Looked in the face of death and took it's mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl's face South and her ass North

That's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still
Wet cause you just took a shower

Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool

Couple things due but you always get it done
Might have been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you'll always be the one

One, I wonder why the moon look nice, girl
Maybe it's just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife

That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
'Cause you don't love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise

I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?

But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble – big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered

I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot

I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit

Made a living and a killing off it

Packing a MAC in the back of the Ac, backpack rap, yap-yap, yacketty-yack

And now at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half

Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack

It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece, yeah

Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard

Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid, I did nothing but shoot for the moon since
*pew*

MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme

Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N-
-W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim

Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up, and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game till I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay looking boy

So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
You witnessing a massacre
Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre looking boy
I'mma work for everything I have
Never asked nobody for shit, get out my face looking boy
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
Of keeping up with the same pace looking boy

Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard

So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating

I'm out my Ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though

For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind

So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to censor you
Like that one line I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP
One where I tried to say I'd take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm

Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
You write normal, fuck being normal
And I just bought a new raygun from the future

To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether’s pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh, man, that was the 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
""Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you""
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, JJ Fad

Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he's too mainstream
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip-hop, it's pop, 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it

I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
It’s curtains, I’m inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to prove
That if you were half as nice, your songs and you could sacrifice virgins too

School flunky, pill junky
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue and cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D. &amp; The Boyz, still chunky, but funky
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me

They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
Understand the discrimination

But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake it for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas

Don't,Ed Sheeran,10/26/2014,10,10,19,"I met this girl late last year
She said ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away four months until our paths crossed again
She told me ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

For a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
But she was kissing him, how? I was confused about
She should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, but I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
All this time, God knows I'm singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold

Fifteen years old smoking hand rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when we found
Weekend jobs when we got paid we'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way, driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real

Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
Ones already on his second wife
Ones just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember these old country lanes

Scars To Your Beautiful,Alessia Cara,02/05/2017,10,10,22,"She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I could go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
So to all the girls that's hurting
Let me be your mirror, help you see a little bit clearer
The light that shines within

I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said, ""I don't have any answers.""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say ""What a wonderful feeling!""
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling
But nothin' is sealing, like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pin humility

Songs about nothin' and mumble!
And fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up

Way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's with the G raps and Kane's hat
We need 3 stacks ASAP, and bring Masta Ace back
Because half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact with a old-me at the same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know a button to press or a lever to pull
They give me the snap though (bitch)
And if I payin' attention I'm probably makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' the dicks in the fuckin' back, ho (get it?)
On the brink in a minute
Got me thinkin' of finishin' everything
With acetaminophen then reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 to 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy, I made a navigator
Motherfucker know I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote till the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ay
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain would pour

I'm sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch I don't know who the fuck y'all are
To give a sub-par bar
Even have an opinion if you, you mention me
Millions of views, attention the news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give a shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get what the fuck half the shit is that you're listening t-to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Probably no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adios
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me kill the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (evil, but spelled)
Jam a Crest white strip in the tip of my dick with an ice pick
Stick it in a vice grip, hang it on a spike fence
Bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ballsack and flick it like a light switch
Like vice-president Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine-tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ man, how many times is someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You will never see Em icy, but as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch I got the club on smash like a nightstick (yeah)
Turn down for what? I ain't loud enough
Nah, turn the valium up
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut now
When it doesn't matter what caliber I spit at
I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks you'll just turn around and just be like
""Man, how the fuck sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks and now he wants to take it out on us?"" (ooh)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (ooh)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Iggy 'zae
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with being humble
And rumor is I'm hungry
I'm sure you heard bumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumbling but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you
That's what it's comin' to
What the fuck are you gonna do, where you runnin' to?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole
Or Sean then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK, you expect a Whopper
You can order a quarter pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are acting like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals should have been auto-tuned and you would have bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it 'cause you missed the line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be, regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom if I don't
Pull myself from the jaws of defeat
And rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get impeached
My enemies die
I don't ceasefire till at least all are deceased
I'm eastside, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep
Not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze

But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (yeah)
Invite them in like a one a day
I'm not done (preach)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turnin'
Is makin' it seem worthless
It's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just trying to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critique the worship
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scared to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person
To see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists""
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said my beef is more meaty, a journalist
They can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis

Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

Lil Wayne
I see niggas in this bitch, stuntin', popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches and when they leave, they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch and really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit
And when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love it
I be with bitches that be with bitches that be with niggas with riches
I tell her, ""Get 'em"" she say, ""I got you"" I say, ""No, bitch, I say get 'im""
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy, he hit it and sleep on her titties
And she give us the word, we come through and in case it's a stick up, she scream like a victim
Now you, feeling so silly
I smoke color purple
I'm up in here feeling like Celie (ooh)
Nappy ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (ooh)
You can get snaked, you can get faced
I'll buy the bitch that you feeling
'Cause you thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee
And you telling your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you're feeling
All of the beans you be spilling
To you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillings
She know where you hide to tell me where it's hidden
She know when you're gone, tell me when to visit, we'll break in your home
And take the specifics and me while the bitch is on vacation with him so she don't get blamed
We don't snatch chains, we find out addresses
And we don't leave messes
You only know that it's gone when you check it
Then your first thought is to start second guessing
She say, ""What's wrong?""
You say, ""Nothing, keep resting""
She say, ""What's missing?"" ""How you know something missing?""
He scratch his head, she say get back in bed
And she gave him some head
Boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say
Ooh, I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches and when they leave, they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches that's with the niggas we following
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind and tell them hoes, don't be so obvious
Mona Lisa
Long hair, don't care, she handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'im, ""Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place""
And if he say, ""Yeah,"" then we meet him there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share
I, know a bitch named Liz, this nigga think she his
'Cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me, and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people, and they already know him
And then I call Liz and she say he comin' over
I say, ""Good girl, just remember what I told you""
She gave me the salute, I say, ""Girl, you're a soldier""
We're waitin' outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door and right before he knock, she open the door naked
She left it unlocked
They started French kissing so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the cloud
Turn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him
Piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown
Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around, I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
You know what it is, put your fucking hands up
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we're after
If Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip something in it, now thank for me, nigga

Ah, everyday she wake up with a different color make up
And I promise to go take her to the movie and the mall
Chilling with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter, fourth minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi looking at them both popping up and take a picture, uh
Probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admitting that he love her on his mother
Man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
Mona Lisa
Pussy good enough, it got 'em sending into wars
And he digging in it like he living in it
Make a new religion with it
Man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree, sweet tone like a hummingbird, when she asked him, did he want to make love in a yellow taxi
Never gave two fuck, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm more jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout a motherfucking double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked this dick, that's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone (No)
You fucking with Wayne? (No)
Bitch, gimme your phone
No, let me take this call real quick
...Lick me like a lollipop
He on your fucking ringtone?
Is that the shit that you do?
Touching yourself, looking at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watching his interviews
I don't know what the fuck, lately gotten into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma daycare after school
And she never did charge her
You scandalous as fuck, and I hope you blow up
You know what, I get buck, let me go get my gun, I got one in the chamber
I'm plannin' on aimin', God dammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killing that pussy I'm killing myself

With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the fountain of youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans

Talent is God-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like ""dun-dun-dun-dun""
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself ""It's just you and I""
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath to effort
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let them drop and roll
